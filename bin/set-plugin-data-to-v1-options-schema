# This little script is to help with manual integration of the auto-upgrade
# feature from the former implementation of the removeUnregisteredClients option
# to the new conflict detection and resolution feature.
#
# Make sure the Font Awesome plugin is already active before doing this (otherwise),
# the effect of this script will be overwritten when you active.
#
# Also activate the integration test plugins: plugin-gamma and plugin-delta.
# These are examples of unregistered clients that enqueue their own versions
# of webfont and svg, respectively.
#
# After activating all three plugins, run this script to reset the font-awesome
# options in the WordPress db to a state like what would be present when running
# plugin version 4.0.0-rc13 (or similar).
#
# Then just reload a page on the site, then go back to the Font Awesome plugin
# settings page, Troubleshooting tab, and expect to see conflicts in the table
# for both plugin-gamma and plugin-delta, already selected for blocking.
#
# NOTE: if your first page load is on the Font Awesome plugin settings page itself,
# then you'll have to re-load it before you see those blocked conflicts show up
# on the Troubleshooting tab.
#
# (This is because the REST API call issued by the admin React app doesn't actual
# run the auto-upgrade detection/blocking logic. However, the WordPress request
# that loads the HTML page on which the the React app is mounted *does* run that
# auto-detection and blocking logic. Once it does that once, it'll store its
# results in the database. Then, subsequent calls on the REST API will fetch
# those results from the db.)
#
# To try the scenario where it's an upgrade but the former state did *not*
# have removeUnregisteredClients enabled, and where you expect there *not* to be
# any automatic detection or blocking of conflicts, just temporarily edit the
# json payload below, setting removeUnregisteredClients: false
