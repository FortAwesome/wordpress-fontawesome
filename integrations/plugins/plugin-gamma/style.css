/**
 * The glyph associated with the v4 icon named "diamond" with unicode f219 appears in FA5 and FA6
 * as the icon named "gem" with unicode f3a5. That glyph look the "precious stone" diamond.
 * 
 * The glyph associated with the icon named "diamond" and unicode f3a5 in FA5 and FA6 is
 * like the diamond as a suit in playing cards.
 *
 * Without all of the compatibility assets to fix up such mappings, any old pseudo-elements that
 * used the v4 font-family of "FontAwesome" with a unicode of f219, when rendered using the FA5 or
 * FA6 fonts, will get the "suit" diamond instead of the "precious stone" diamond.
