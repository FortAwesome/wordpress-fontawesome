Loads Font Awesome 5 Free or Pro, managing version resolution across multiple client themes or plugins.

== Description ==

Loads Font Awesome 5 Free or Pro on your WordPress site. Provides features for developers of themes and other plugins
to register their Font Awesome requirements with this plugin to ensure that a single, working version of Font Awesome
is loaded that works across all WordPress components. Optionally, block some themes or plugins from trying to load
their own versions of Font Awesome which might create conflicts and keep your icons from working correctly.

Supports both Free and Pro, optional use of version 4 compatibility (shims), pseudo-elements, and either the [Webfont
with CSS](https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/setup/getting-started?using=web-fonts-with-css) or
[SVG with JavaScript](https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/setup/getting-started?using=svg-with-js) method.

Loads Font Awesome from the official Font Awesome Free or Pro CDN.
